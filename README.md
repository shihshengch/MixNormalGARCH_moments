Multi-Step-Ahead Analytic Moments of Mix Normal GARCH(1,1)

Alexander et al. (2013) have proposed using analytic GARCH model to compute the multi-step-ahead VaR estimates by matching the multi-step-ahead moments to Johnson SU distribution. Haas (2019) has derived the multi-step-ahead moments of aggregated Mixed Normal GARCH returns. These codes applies the analytic moments from Haas (2019) to Alexander's method.
